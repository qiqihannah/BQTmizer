# BQTmizer: A Tool for Test Case Minimization with Quantum Annealing

## Introduction
BQTmizer is a tool based on [BootQA](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3680467). It leverages quantum annealing (QA) to tackle large-scale real-world test case minimization (TCM) problems, which aims to select the smallest test suite while satisfying all testing objectives. It is a classical-quantum hybrid tool that integrates
classical bootstrap sampling to optimize the use of limited number of available  qubits in the current QA hardware.
